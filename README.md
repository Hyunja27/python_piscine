# 🏊‍♂️ Piscine Python Django

## 🏊‍♂️ What is a piscine?

Much like the selection piscine, the project is split in many small projects (days), and with each day a new notion on the language/paradigm/technology you chose to work on. Each weekend offers you the possibility to do a rush, a group project with a random student matched with you. Validating a piscine requires more than just a day or two of investment.

### We are looking at:

- Your investment on both weeks: you can’t validate the piscine if you work only one
  week
- Trying to turn in every day: even if something isn’t finished, it’s better to try and
  turn it in
- At least one weekend of work: going into the piscine shouldn’t be taken lightly. We
  expect you to validate at least one of the two rushes.
- After the end of the piscine, you have two weeks to do all the required peerevaluations

### ✅ Score
